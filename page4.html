    <h4>Benifts and risks</h4>
    <h6>Pros and Cons of Artificial Intelligence – A Threat or a Blessing?</h6>
    <img src="https://blog.essaycorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Benefits-And-Risks-Of-Artificial-Intelligence-AI.jpg" width="600" height="350">
    <p>Most researchers agree that a superintelligent AI is unlikely to exhibit human emotions like love or hate, and that there is no reason to expect AI to become intentionally benevolent or malevolent. Instead, when considering how AI might become a risk, experts think two scenarios most likely:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The AI is programmed to do something devastating: Autonomous weapons are artificial intelligence systems that are programmed to kill. In the hands of the wrong person, these weapons could easily cause mass casualties. Moreover, an AI arms race could inadvertently lead to an AI war that also results in mass casualties. To avoid being thwarted by the enemy, these weapons would be designed to be extremely difficult to simply “turn off,” so humans could plausibly lose control of such a situation. This risk is one that’s present even with narrow AI, but grows as levels of AI intelligence and autonomy increase.</li>
        <li>The AI is programmed to do something beneficial, but it develops a destructive method for achieving its goal: This can happen whenever we fail to fully align the AI’s goals with ours, which is strikingly difficult. If you ask an obedient intelligent car to take you to the airport as fast as possible, it might get you there chased by helicopters and covered in vomit, doing not what you wanted but literally what you asked for. If a superintelligent system is tasked with a ambitious geoengineering project, it might wreak havoc with our ecosystem as a side effect, and view human attempts to stop it as a threat to be met.</li>
    </ol>  
    <p>As these examples illustrate, the concern about advanced AI isn’t malevolence but competence. A super-intelligent AI will be extremely good at accomplishing its goals, and if those goals aren’t aligned with ours, we have a problem. You’re probably not an evil ant-hater who steps on ants out of malice, but if you’re in charge of a hydroelectric green energy project and there’s an anthill in the region to be flooded, too bad for the ants. A key goal of AI safety research is to never place humanity in the position of those ants.</p>
    <h6>Pros of AI:</h6>
    <h7>Less Room for Errors;</h7>
    <p>As decisions taken by a machine are based on previous records of data and the set of algorithms, the chances of errors reduce. This is an achievement, as solving complex problems that require difficult calculation, can be done without any scope of error.

        Have you heard of digital assistants? Advanced business organizations use digital assistants to interact with users, something that helps save them time. This helps businesses fulfil user demands without keeping them waiting. They are programmed to give the best possible assistance to a user.</p>
    <h7>Right Decision Making;</h7>
    <p>The complete absence of emotions from a machine makes it more efficient as they are able to take the right decisions in a short span of time. The best example of this is its usage in healthcare. The integration of AI tools in the healthcare sector has improved the efficiency of treatments by minimizing the risk of false diagnosis.</p>
    <h7>Can Work Continuously;</h7>
    <p>Unlike humans, machine does not get tired, even if it has to work for consecutive hours. This is a major benefit over the humans, who need rest time to time to be efficient. However, in the case of machines, their efficiency is not affected by any external factor and it does not get in the way of continuous work.</p>
    <h6>Cons of AI:</h6>
    <h7>Expensive to Implement;</h7>
    <p>When combining the cost of installation, maintenance and repair, AI is an expensive proposition. Those of who have huge funds can implement it. However, businesses and industries that do not have funds will find it difficult to implement AI technology into their processes or strategies.</p>
    <h7>Dependency on Machines;</h7>
    <p>With the dependency of humans on machines increasing, we’re headed into a time where it becomes difficult for humans to work without the assistance of a machine. We’ve seen it in the past and there’s no doubt we’ll continue seeing it in the future, our dependency on machines will only increase. As a result, mental and thinking abilities of humans will actually decrease over time.</p>
    <h7>Displace Low Skilled Jobs;</h7>
    <p>This is the primary concern for technocrats so far. It is quite possible that AI will displace many low skilled jobs. As machines can work 24*7 with no break, industries prefer investing in machines as compared to humans. As we are moving towards the automated world, where almost every task will be done by the machines, there is a possibility of large-scale unemployment. A real-time example of this is the concept of driverless cars. If the concept of driverless cars kicks in, millions of drivers will be left unemployed in the future.</p>
    <h7>In berief we can say that Artificial intelligence isn't just improving lives; in some cases, it will save lives. There are many companies, including tech companies, that are investing in and researching ways that artificial intelligence can help improve our healthcare system. From figuring out personalized drug protocols to better diagnostic tools and even robots to assist in surgeries, AI is altering our healthcare system from its processes to the care that these organizations provide.                                               In addition to our healthcare systems, AI is likely to be very instrumental in solving the environmental concerns we are experiencing due to global warming. From supporting smart infrastructure to helping to be more efficient with our natural resources and smart agriculture to feed a growing population, AI can augment our human efforts to solve our global challenges.</h7>

        <h5>The Need for Artificial Intelligence</h5>
        <p>It might be easier to state what part of our modern society artificial intelligence (AI) hasn’t touched to show how important it is to our daily lives, business operations and society. Intelligence machines are influencing nearly every facet of our lives to help improve efficiencies and augment our human capabilities. AI is so intertwined in all that we do; it's hard to imagine living life without it.</p>
        <h7>Need for Artificial Intelligence :</h7>
        <p>We are growing at huge rate, say it in terms of population, scripted knowledge, tasks etc. Increasing in scale also increase entropy in system, demanding huge number of tasks to be automated, and centralized. AI in simple words is implementing human senses in machines. Humans will surely benefit from UI. Though we are seeing automation of tasks is leading to job cutting, in long term it is going to turn out to be a major benefit.

            AI can surely process all trivial tasks at huge pace compared to humans.
            
            Traffic Control, Automating Support, Automating Manufacturing, Fraud Detection, Imposing Laws without corruption etc. It has many good uses.</p>
        <h7>Applications of Artificial Intelligence:</h7>
        <p>The applications for artificial intelligence are endless. The technology can be applied to many different sectors and industries. AI is being tested and used in the healthcare industry for dosing drugs and different treatment in patients, and for surgical procedures in the operating room.

            Other examples of machines with artificial intelligence include computers that play chess and self-driving cars. Each of these machines must weigh the consequences of any action they take, as each action will impact the end result. In chess, the end result is winning the game. For self-driving cars, the computer system must account for all external data and compute it to act in a way that prevents a collision.
            
            
            Artificial intelligence also has applications in the financial industry, where it is used to detect and flag activity in banking and finance such as unusual debit card usage and large account deposits—all of which help a bank's fraud department. Applications for AI are also being used to help streamline and make trading easier. This is done by making supply, demand, and pricing of securities easier to estimate.</p>

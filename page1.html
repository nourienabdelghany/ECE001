        <h4>History of Artificial Intelligence – AI of the past, present and the future!</h4>
        <p>
            Artificial Intelligence is not a new word and not a new technology for researchers. <br>This technology is much older than you would imagine.
            <br> The beginnings of artificial intelligence are traced to philosophy, fiction, and imagination.<br> As there are the myths of Mechanical men in Ancient Greek and Egyptian Myths.

        <h5>AI of the past, present and the future!</h5>
        <h6>The past</h6>
        <p1>
          1950 is the time when it all started the concept has been around for decades but, until 1950, people were unaware of the term. <br> As The first patent for the invention of the telephone happened in 1876 and AI was introduced at a much later stage.In true terms, <br>the field of AI research was founded at a workshop held on the campus of Dartmouth College during the summer of 1956. <br>At that time, it was predicted that a machine as intelligent as a human being would exist in no more than a generation,<br> they were given millions of dollars to make this vision come true. In 1974 Computers flourished. <br>Gradually with time, the wave of computers started. With time, they became faster, more affordable and able to store more information. <br>The best part was that they could think abstractly, able to self-recognize and achieved Natural Language Processing. <br>In 1980, AI research fired back up with an expansion of funds and algorithmic tools. With deep learning techniques, <br>the computer learned with the user experience.
          After all the failed attempts, the technology was successfully established but, <br>until it was in the 2000s that the landmark goals were achieved. At that time, AI thrived despite a lack of government funds and public attention.

        <h6>The present</h6>
        <p1>We all might be aware of the present situation, and what value does AI holds in our lives. AI collects and organizes large amounts of <br>information to make insights and guesses that are beyond the human capabilities of manual processing. Amazing! Isn’t it? <br>With its increasing organizational efficiencies, the likelihood of a mistake and detected irregular patterns is reduced. <br>So, if we talk about spam or fraud, or the warning it provides to business in real-time about suspicious activity, a lot has been safeguarded already.</p1>
        <h6>The future</h6>
        <p1>If AI is the future, then there is absolutely no doubt. Starting from healthcare, education, e-commerce to water power, electricity and assembly lines, <br>everything is automated. Such machines and technologies have helped humans to achieve efficiency and effectiveness.There is a big shift in a way we live, <br>work and relate to one another due to the adoption of cyber-physical systems, Internet of Things and the Internet of Systems. <br>With Self Aware Systems, human-like intelligence has been developed. With Artificial Superintelligence and AI algorithms, <br>the machines are capable of outperforming the smartest of humans in every single domain. We all know what the future is, but there is a bit of uncertainty of how it will be presented and what changes will it do to the generations. Will it have a positive impact or will there be some negative repercussions?
           Until now, there have also been some Artificial Intelligence systems that were specialists, e.g. AlphaGo (Zero), that mastered Go and were able to outperform human Grandmaster player. Superintelligence takes Artificial Intelligence to the next stage. Superintelligence refers to smarter than a human platform that can outperform a human in any intellectual task.The question, when there will be AGI and when there will be superintelligence, is, of course, difficult to answer (as nearly all answers refer to future prediction). Nick Bostrom, who is an AI researcher at Oxford University, evaluates this question in a paper.
          You must have heard of the warnings given by Stephen Hawking, Elon Musk, and Bill Gates. The predictions are negative but, I will eagerly be looking to see what researchers produce in this field in the future. Be it Artificial Intelligence, Superintelligence – AI takeover?</p1>
        <h6>We can summarize the highlights of AI history in the following table.</h6>
